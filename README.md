Now let us understand how to setup the project

Step1 : 1) Go the the Backend folder : cd Backend
2) Then for downloading all the dependencies run this command: npm install
3) Now since I've already added the env variables and have used the mysql server from aivendb just for simplicity in the execution of this project you can directly start the server using this command : npm start
  And now you will see the logs: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/471125e2-5341-4c2a-8ded-f3950c52e61b)

Step2 : 1) Go to the frontend folder in a separate terminal : cd frontend
2)Now run the command: npm install
3) Now simply start the project using this command : npm run dev
Now you will be directed to the port: 3000 and the project is ready to use.
